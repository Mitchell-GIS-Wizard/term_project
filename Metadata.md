All the Data that made RockHub possible!

#
**Alberta** 

Publisher: Alberta Geological Survey

https://geology-ags-aer.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ags-aer::simplified-bedrock-geology-ags-map-600/explore

Data Verison: September 9, 2021

Date Collected: April 1, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the compilation of existing geological bedrock for the province of Alberta. It contains both shapefiles and ArcGIS layers. In addition has been modified to contain just geological composition. 

#
**British Columbia** 

Publisher: Government of British Columbia

https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/british-columbia-geological-survey/geology/bcdigitalgeology

Data Verison: 2019

Date Collected: April 1, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the territory of Yukon. It contains 
shapefiles and ArcMap layers. In addition the attribute table has been simplified to shrink the data for the mybinder platform.

#
**Manitoba** 

Publisher: Government of Manitoba

https://www.gov.mb.ca/iem/geo/gis/databases.html

Data Verison: 2021 Survey

Date Collected: April 3, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the province of Manitoba. The shapefile used for the map has been modified heavily using ArcMap Pro. Similar rock types were dissolved into larger polygons to reduce complex geometry files. 

#
**New Brunswick** 

Publisher: Government of New Brunswick

https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/erd/open-data/data_download.html#bedrock

Data Verison: 2018

Date Collected: April 2, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the province of New Brunswick. The file has been altered as New Brunswick has complex geometry that requires more data storage. To shrink the file the attribute table has removed all data except for rock type & geometry. 

#
**Northwest Territories** 

Publisher: Government of Northwest Territories

https://ntgs-open-data-ntgs.hub.arcgis.com

Data Verison: August 2016

Date Collected: April 1, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the Northwest Territories. Due to that fact that NWT covers a large area very few full reports exist with complete coverage. Therefore the shapefile has been modified to combine the limited available data here.

#
**Nova Sctoia** 

Publisher: 

https://novascotia.ca/natr/meb/geoscience-online/interactive-bedrock-geo-map.asp

Data Verison: 2006

Date Collected: April 7, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the province of Nova Scotia. The dataset has been altered but only overlayed with the province shape to clip out the geoolgy of the ocean floor that the survey included. 

#
**Nunavut** 

Publisher: Canada-Nunavut Geoscience Office

https://cngo.ca/cngo-ofm/

Data Verison: 2020

Date Collected: April 1, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the territory of Nunavut. This dataset has been heavily altered because there is very little available data, though after collecting data and combining into one file on ArcMap the Nunavut shapefile does represent the geology of Nunavut.

#
**Ontario** 

Publisher: Government of Ontario

https://www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca/ogsearth.html

Data Verison: April 4 2022

Date Collected: April 2, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the rovince of Ontario. The survey was completed by the Governemnt of Onatrio, but they included a large amount of addition data such as formartion era/epoch/epriod, though it was unfinished; it has been removed. Afterwards the same rock type areas were dissolved together to simiplfy the model. 

#
**Prince Edward Island** 

Publisher: Government of Prince Edward Island

http://www.gov.pe.ca/gis/index.php3?number=1021412&lang=E

Data Verison: 2002 Survey

Date Collected: April 5, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the province of PEI. The file of PEI is much larger as it contains complex geometrys. The dataset has only had the attribute table altered to remove unimportant data with regards to RockHubs functionality. 

#
**Quebec** 

Publisher: 

https://sigeom.mines.gouv.qc.ca/signet/classes/I0000_serviceWeb?l=a

Data Verison: 2021

Date Collected: April 7, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the province of Quebec. This dataset has only had the attribute table altered for the purpose of RockHub. The province is rather homogenous and does not require dissolve action. 

#
**Saskatchewan** 

Publisher: 

https://geohub.saskatchewan.ca/datasets/c01ad3808acd4a9f82fc8b94169ec1e9/about

Data Verison: November 20, 2019

Date Collected: April 4, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the province of Saskatchewan. The dataset has just had the attribute table simplified for the purposes of Rockhub. 

#
**Yukon** 

Publisher: Government of Yukon 

https://data.geology.gov.yk.ca/Compilation/3#InfoTab

Data Verison: January 2022

Date Collected: April 8, 2023

Summary: This dataset represents the complication of existing geological bedrock in the territory of Yukon. This file also contained shapefules for faults and groundwater information, as this does not pretain to the use of RockHub they have been removed.
