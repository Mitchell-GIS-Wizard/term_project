### Welcome to RockHub! ###
#
**Mission Statement**:

Providing Canadians with the opportunity to understand their environment more and encourage more informed development. 

#
**How does it work?**: 

Geological data for provinces can be found publicly but accessing the data in a simple and user friendly way is challenging, so at RockHub we do the heavy lifting! We have collected the most up to date geological data across all provinces and territories, using python programming we have created a the RockHub database which we call the Batholith. The Batholith not only has federal boundaries but we have simplified the data and manipulated it heavily to ensure all computers, even Macbooks from 2015 can run it; this information cannot be found anywhere else! Enjoy Rockhub and never forget to rock on. 

#
**Why is this important?**

There is no user friendly web atlas that allows users to play and interact with Canadian bedrock and we believe that geoscience is vital to a sustainble future. Making Canadians more aware of their environment is important because we believe that if you undertsand your environment you will be more respectful to it. And last but not least, ROCKS ROCK!
