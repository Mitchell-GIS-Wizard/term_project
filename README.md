### Welcome to RockHub! ###

**Mission Statement**:
#
Providing Canadians with the opportunity to understand their environment more and encourage more informed development. 


**How does it work?**: 
#
Geological data for provinces can be found publicly but accessing the data in a simple and user friendly way is challenging, so at RockHub we do the heavy lifting! We have collected the most up to date geological data across all provinces and territories, using python programming we have created a the RockHub database which we call the Batholith. The Batholith not only has federal boundaries but we have created several grouped geographical areas such as the west coast, east coast, and prairies; this information cannot be found anywhere else! Enjoy Rockhub and never forget to rock on.
